    "`transform`: The set of torchvision transforms to be applied to the images before they are input into the model before prediction. <b>Note:</b> This variable should be identical to the one in Program 3 that was used to train the model, otherwise the predictions will be very incorrect.\\\n",
    "`batch_size`: The amount of images per DataLoader batch. Heavily affects VRAM usage. Speed testing has determined 128 to be optimal for my hardware.\\\n",
    "`num_workers`: The amount of workers for the DataLoader to use to parallelize training. Affects system RAM usage. Speed testing has determined 8 to be optimal for my hardware. <b>Note:</b> Windows is incapable of parallelizing Jupyter Notebooks like this; therefore, this variable will be set to 0 if on Windows.\\\n",
    "`freeze_model`: Flag to determine whether or not to freeze all layers of the model except the final layer. Testing has shown better prediction performance with this set to False. <b>Note:</b> This should be set to the same value as was used in Program 3 to train the model.\\\n",
    "`num_classes`: The number of output classes to be added to the new final layer of the model. <b>Note:</b> This should be the same as the number of output classes used in Program 3 when training the model.\\\n",
    "`do_entire_image`: Flag to determine whether to make predictions over an entire image or a small section. <b>Warning:</b> If this is False, any image that will be predicted on needs to have both a row and collumn slice. The program will throw a reminder error if this is not done.\\\n",
    "`row_slices`: Dictionary whose keys are sample image file names, like `SAMPLE_IMAGE_DICT`. The values are lists containing ranges that denote the slices of rows to be predicted on for a particular slice on the image in the key. Only used if `do_entire_image` is False. <b>Note:</b> Matches rows to collumns based on location in the list.\\\n",
    "`col_slices`: Dictionary whose keys are sample image file names, like `SAMPLE_IMAGE_DICT`. The values are lists containing ranges that denote the slices of collumns to be predicted on for a particular slice on the image in the key. Only used if `do_entire_image` is False. <b>Note:</b> Matches collumns to rows based on location in the list.\\\n",
    "`do_certain_images`: Flag to determine whether to do every image contained in `SAMPLE_IMAGE_DICT`. If True, only images in `images_to_do` will have predictions made. Otherwise, all sample images are done.\\\n",
    "`images_to_do`: A list containing the full sample image file names as strings of every sample image you want to be predicted on. <b>Warning:</b> If `do_entire_image` is False and `do_certain_images` is True, any image in this list must have row and collumn slices denoted in `row_slices` and `col_slices` respectively.\\\n",
    "`window_size`: The size of one side of the square window to use for predictions. <b>Note:</b> Default is 200. Should be the same number used in Program 1 to generate the training images.\\\n",
    "`window_radius`: The window radius to use when making predictions. Half of the `window_size`. <b>Note:</b> If the next variable, `image_scaling_testing` is `True`, this value will be multiplied by the value in `multiplier` as well.\\\n",
    "`image_scaling_testing`: Flag to determine whether to scale the image when making predictions. Testing has found that scaling an image down speeds up prediction times at the cost of accuracy due to the data loss involved with lowering resolution. <b>Deprecated:</b> Pixel skip does better in both time and accuracy metrics. This functionality may or may not even work.\\\n",
    "`multiplier`: The multiplier to use when scaling an image. >1 for up-scaling. >0 and <1 for down-scaling.\\\n",
    "`enable_pixel_skip`: Flag to determine whether to use pixel-skipping when making predictions. Testing has found it significantly speeds up prediction times with minimal cost to accuracy as long as `pixel_skip` is small.\\\n",
    "`pixel_skip`: The number of pixels to skip both horizontally and vertically. 5 is what we currently use. <b>Warning:</b> Large numbers will lose prediction accuracy as entire smaller follicles could be missed and prediction blobs become blockier.\\\n",
    "`save_figs`: Flag to determine whether to save any extra figures created in this notebook for analysis purposes.\\\n",
    "`save_dataframes`: Flag to determine whether to save the prediction dataframes that are created in this program. <b>Note:</b> Requires `save_figs` to be True for this to have an effect.\\\n",
    "`use_amp`: Flag to determine whether or not to use PyTorch's Automatic Mixed Precision. Can significantly boost performance with minimal cost to calculation accuracy.\\\n",
    "`multiple_epochs`: Flag to determine if predictions are going to be made using checkpoints from every epoch generated by Program 3 when its `save_each_epoch` flag is True.\\\n",
    "`num_epochs`: The number of epochs that Program 3 was run with if the `save_each_epoch` flag was True. Only used when `multiple_epochs` is True.\\\n",
    "`checkpoint_name`: The unique addition to the end of `CHECKPOINT` to know the checkpoint file to use. Currently, the program expects \"epoch_\" or another 6 characters to be at the end of `CHECKPOINT` to be replaced by this variable. Only used when `multiple_epochs` is False."
